# Ride_Sharing_Application
This Tkinter-based application facilitates ride-sharing by allowing users to carpool based on their destination and needs.
Users can input their starting point and destination, and the application utilizes a map navigator feature to find optimal
routes and match users with similar itineraries for shared rides. Additionally, the application incorporates features for
scheduling, and cost-sharing arrangements, providing a convenient and efficient platform
for collaborative transportation.
